## 🚀 What I love most about DevSpot
Obvisouly I love my team!! but also..

DevSpot is the kind of work that actually gets me excited to open my laptop. It moves fast, it matters, and the little decisions we make end up shaping the experience for thousands of hackers and organizers. That’s wild when you really think about it.

What I love most is the mix of community and engineering. One minute I’m thinking through edge cases in a payment flow, the next I’m watching someone submit their project five minutes before the deadline. When something feels smooth on the front end, it’s usually because we obsessed over the details behind the scenes. I love that.
