# DevSpot ✨

This repo is a little snapshot of me + what I’m building and obsessed with.

## 🚀 What I love most about DevSpot

### The short version
DevSpot is my favorite kind of work: high-speed building with real stakes, where tiny product decisions ripple into the experience of thousands of hackers and organizers. I love the mix of community + engineering—shipping flows that remove friction, making hard things feel simple, and watching people go from “idea” → “submission” → “winner” in a weekend.

### The deeper version
I love that DevSpot sits at the intersection of:
- **Community energy** (hackers creating under pressure)
- **Product clarity** (turn chaos into a smooth flow)
- **Engineering craft** (secure, scalable, clean systems)
- **Momentum** (shipping fast and iterating constantly)
